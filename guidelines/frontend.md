# Frontend specific guidelines

1. **Shorter User journeys:** Make the user journey as short as possible. For instance, you go to the site, you search for something, and you find what you're looking for. Instead of asking users to go through like 10 pages, because then when we can reduce the number of pages.
2. **Minimising contents:** Minimize the content that is downloaded, optimize CSS, and compress everything you can for instance the photos or videos or whatever you're displaying.
3. **Use of WebP:** WebP is considered efficient format for image to use but make sure to check the compatibility of this format with the older browser versions.
4. **Follow Accessibility Guidelines:** Follow the guidelines from [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. 
5. **Less is more:** Eliminate unnecessary elements of of the web service like animations if not needed.
6. **Dark theme:** Dark themes can reduce energy consumption, especially on OLED and AMOLED screens where black pixels are essentially turned off, saving power.
