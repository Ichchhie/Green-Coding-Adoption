# Architecture and Design patterns specific suggestions

1. Use Microservices architecture when possible.
   - Break down applications into smaller, modular services to enhance maintainability, scalability, and isolation of concerns.

2. Use design patterns such as:
   - modular design
   - asynchronous processing
   - Lazy Loading: Load resources or data only when needed.
   - Use Memoization and Caching 

6. Utilize Object Pooling: Reuse expensive-to-create objects (e.g., database connections) instead of repeatedly creating and destroying them.

7. Leverage Multithreading or Concurrent Programming: Parallelize computational tasks where appropriate to better utilize CPU resources.

8. Design for Minimalism and Efficiency: Always aim to do the minimal amount of processing necessary, fetching only required data and optimizing ping frequency.
