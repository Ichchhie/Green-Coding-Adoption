# Backend specific suggestions:

1. **Use In-Memory Caching to Reduce Database Load:** Implement caching to store frequently accessed data, such as user sessions or lookup tables, in server memory rather than querying the database on each request.
2. **Database specific:**
   - Optimize Data Fetching Strategies:
      - Analyze how much data is fetched, how often, and from where, to ensure it is wise and efficient.
      - Don't fetch everything. Limiting the columns you are fetching. Filter what do you want to fetch.
   - Perform Regular Database Engine Optimization
     - Run maintenance scripts daily or weekly to optimize indexes, clean up unused or redundant data and improve overall query performance
   - Optimise database queries: Write efficient SQL queries to minimize data scanned, execution time and redundant joins.
   - Use indexing, for efficient query execution for large datasets.
