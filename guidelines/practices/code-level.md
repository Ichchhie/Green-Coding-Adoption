# Code level optimization:

1. Algorithm specific:
   - Choose Efficient Algorithms for Computation
　　  - Evaluate algorithms carefully: Choose algorithms that are best suited for the task from both performance and sustainability standpoints.
     - Use Memory-Efficient String Operations
       - Example: Instead of using string concatenation with + in loops or large-scale operations, use StringBuilder or StringBuffer (in Java or similar constructs in other languages) to reduce memory allocation overhead.
     - Extract Constants Outside Functions to Reduce Memory Usage
       – Move constant values outside frequently called functions so they’re initialized only once, reducing repeated memory allocation and improving performance.
2. Choose Appropriate Data Structures: 
    – Use dictionaries or hash maps over lists for faster lookups.
    - Use ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations.
    - Prefer linked lists when linear traversal or frequent insertions/deletions are required.
4. Clean code:
    - Use SOLID principles, details [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
    - Use Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions
      - Choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to reflect their purpose.
      - Follow standard naming patterns to maintain consistency across the codebase.
    - Use Modular Functions
      - Break code into small, reusable, and focused functions that do one thing well.
5. Code refactoring:
    - Refactor Inefficient Code Structures: Continuously revisit and improve existing code, including algorithms, data structures, and general structure, to enhance performance and maintain readability.
6. Code Reviews: 
    – Perform regular peer code reviews focused on quality, security, and optimization to ensure efficient and secure code.
7. Error handling: 
    – Implement error checks as early as possible to avoid unnecessary processing and reduce resource waste.
