## üöÄ About This Project

This repository is part of my thesis research on **Adoption of Green Coding in Software Companies: 
A Comparative Study of Practices in Finland, EU, and Globally**.

The goal is to bridge academic insights and industry needs by providing **actionable roadmaps, best practices, and practical tools** that help organizations adopt energy-efficient coding practices in their software development workflow.

## üìö Key Guidelines Summary

### 1. Foundational Design Decisions
- Design for Minimalism and Efficiency: Always aim to do the minimal amount of processing necessary, fetching only required data and optimizing network load. 
- Adopt architecture patterns (e.g., microservices) that optimize resource usage when possible.

### 2. Coding Best Practices
- Avoid unnecessary computations and data processing.  
- Use lazy loading and caching to minimize resource use.
- Use external libraries considerably.

### 3. Tooling & Automation
- Automate energy consumption reporting in CI/CD pipelines, enabling developers to monitor and compare the energy usage of current deployments.

### 4. Testing & Monitoring
- Conduct energy audits alongside functional testing. Use tools like [Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/), [EcoIndex](https://www.ecoindex.fr/en/)

### 5. Team & Process Integration
- Educate and aware developers on green coding principles.  
- Include green coding checks in code reviews using checklists or automation.
